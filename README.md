Widgets are all functional. Speech recognition works as well. Make sure to install the required modules, if not already included.

To access weather data, go to [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get a free API key. Afterwards, make a .env file.


In the .env file, you will only need to write:

weather_api_key = "{ENTER API KEY HERE}"
